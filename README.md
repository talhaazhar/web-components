<h1>WEB Components</h1>

<p>Just a little project I started to introduce myself to the world of web-components, so that I can learn it to develop a project for my job</p>

<p>The main component created is the **<glossary-container>**. The **<glossary-container>** itself uses two components, 
  **<rit-glossary1>** and **<glossary-search>** </p>

``` html
<div></div>
```
